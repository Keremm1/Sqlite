# Sqlite and benefits of ORM
There is a script that has errors but i solved this error with some analyze that is about ORM. 
I noticed ORM is very important for entegration.There was a database and i need to do two jobs on it.
One of these two jobs is use and apply given input in sqlite operation func, last job is saving these values in objects created from classes.
If there is a database software with python applying different from sqlite3, there would be the only job for me to do.
You can realize after i realized that, i didn't continue user interface code in script.
This shows us another issue is not to write effective code.
